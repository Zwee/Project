        <h2 class="bling">First Rule:
        </h2>
        Try not to repeat yourself.
        When going through your code, ask yourself "What do these things have in common, and can I style just that." and "How can I remove repetition?"

          <h4 class="highlighter">Style:
          </h4>
          Can refer to multiple things-
          <ul>
            <li>The HTML element, e.g.: &#60;style&#62;div &#123;color:blue&#125;&#60;&#47;style&#62;
            </li>
            <li>The HTML attribute, e.g.: &#60;div style="color : blue"&#62;text&#60;/div&#62;
            </li>
            <li>The general look of a site, e.g.:  "I like the style of that site, it's fun but easy on the eyes."
            </li>
            <li>A verb, e.g.: "The structure is done, but I jsut need to style it."
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="highlighter">Placeholder:
          </h4>
          Can be thought of like 'find and replace' in Word. You've got a word that's holding a spot that soon another word(s) is/are going to occupy in its place. Like "resident" in a mail merge letter that eventually gets filled in with the name of the resident/recipient for that specific letter.
          E.g.: Placeholder "Body-part" -> Will later be replaced by Eye, or Hair

          <h4 class="highlighter">Rule:
          </h4>
          A line of CSS code that describes a value that a certain attribute should have. E.g.: Rules: Do not brush wet, do not dye, dandruff shampoo only

          <h4 class="highlighter">Property:
          </h4>
          The characteristic that you want to change. E.g.: Hair

          <h4 class="highlighter">Value:
          </h4>
          The quality or quantity you want to assign to the attribute.
          E.g.: Values: blonde, oily, processed, none

          <h4 class="highlighter">Class:
          </h4>
          Refers to a group of elements that can be styled together.
      </div>

        <h3><span class="bling">More Vocabulary:</span>
        </h3>
        <h4><span class="highlighter">ID:</span>
        </h4>
        IDs are unique identifiers that identify a HTML element.
        <h4><span class="highlighter">Comments:</span>
        </h4>
        Comments are lines of text that the computer ignores. They are used to leave notes to yourself or to others who might check out your code in the future.
        -In HTML, code comments are prefixed with &#60;!-- and end with --&#62;
        Everything in between is ignored by the computer.
        -In CSS, code comments begin with /* and end with */. Again, everything in between those two markers is ignored.
