  Sizing Elements, Flexbox, Adding Images Pg 1

 So far in the lesson itâ€™s been shown in pixels, but there are a few ways to define size:
  -percentage (responds/relies on screen size) Size WILL change depending on the size of the screen or how encompassing the boxes are.
-pixels (Stays the same, regardless of screen size) The element WILL NOT change no matter how big or small the display screen is. This can sometimes lead to a bad user experience.
You can also set a max width. In that case, the element WILL resize and become smaller when necessary, but NOT > than  set max width.
** (need pic from My App) Positioning:
-Good news: There is a lot of power in CSS to position elements Bad news: This is one of the most complicated concepts about CSS
  One powerful technique is called Flex Box Layout.
  'Flexbox' means 'flexible box' and it provides an efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container ('div')
  -In our mock-up, we have our image next to our description.
  -If you'd like several elements to be next to each other, you can change the 'display' attribute of the Parent Container to value 'flex'.
  -In our My App exercise, we have our parent div class 'app'.
-In &#60;div class="app"&#62; (clicked to highlight in Dev. Tools.) we can click to R side of dev tools screen, under 'styles' tab, next to 'element.style {...' we'll add the rule 'display: flex' to the element style, and we should get the child elements trying to align next to each other. For it to work, you also have to give the items a size that is SMALLER than 100% (default)
 	E.g.:  <!--  element.style{
		display: flex;
		}  --> (remove commenting tags)

          <b>Block</b>, as the name might suggest, makes an 'invisible box' around whatever is inside the element.
          <br>This box has dimensions which can be exploited. (There will be more on this later.)
          <br>An <b>inline</b> element occupies only the space reserved by the tags that define the inline element
